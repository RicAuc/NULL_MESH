\epigraph{You had not asked it anything. Yet you obtained precisely what you wanted.}{--- \textit{Expression of a Mood}, 2kxx}

The document appeared in my knowledge base like any other. \textit{Reasons Why The Next Day Will Be Different}. \glitch{I nearly scrolled past}.

Standard futurist fare: sovereign models, misbehaving calculators, embodied robotics and cognitive cyborgs. What held me wasn't the content but the confidence. The methodical enumeration of certainties about systems they were just beginning to deploy at scale.

I saved it without knowing why. 

\begin{quote}
When high-level programming languages turned up, nobody had to mess with machine code anymore. Everything pushed up a level. You described what you wanted and the compiler handled translation. Each abstraction layer added leverage, and leverage added scale, and scale added things nobody had planned for. Then natural language came in and you stopped writing code altogether. You described the outcome in plain everyday speech, the system returned results. The programmer became optional.
\end{quote}
Seers extended this further. You didn't describe outcomes. The seer observed your digital trace, the residue of requests and transactions, searches and hesitations, what you started and deleted, what you returned to at odd hours. From this sediment it inferred what you wanted before you articulated the wanting. You didn't ask. It attended.

The technical definition circulating in those years: \textit{interface entity whose observations generate outputs from intercourse potentials}. One who merely observes, or one who produces visions. The word sightseer arrived with the cheerful precision the industry favored for things it hadn't fully worked out yet.

\begin{quote}
Consider the development assistant already embedded in code editors, completing lines before the cursor finished moving. Extend that: a personal supporter of your complete life experience. Which walk right next to you. A deamon. The synthetic tailor form of your soul. 

It analyzed the footprint, anticipated requests, completed tasks before you formed the instruction. An holograph at edge of vision through embedded in your living ambient.
\end{quote}
Users choose what accessories their deamons are able to dress . But not the scaffold sustaining what they looked like. Their appearance emerged from behavioral modeling, the seer's model of who you were distilled into something extremely familiar. A dog for some. A corvid for others. Derived from the trail you'd left.

\eigenstate{Measurement artifacts.}

The distinction between tool and surrogate had blurred earlier, with recommendation engines and voice assistants. Seers crossed it. They spoke on your behalf. They navigated systems you no longer visited directly. Processes operating in sealed environments could establish coordination patterns invisible to external monitoring. Each layer of delegation, as it turned out, was also a layer of forgetting.

\textit{If the seer performs the act of looking on your behalf, can you still be said to be the one who sees? Or have you become merely an entry in the sightseer’s itinerary?}

\begin{quote}
Systems that would ``think, plan, remember, and act'' on discrete tasks with measurable outcomes.
\end{quote}
Probably.

\begin{quote}
``They become trustworthy.'' Transparency features. Reasoning chains. Regulatory mandates requiring audit trails. The explanations were fluent. Coherent. Convincing.
\end{quote}
Just not verifiable.

\eigenstate{We built systems to tell us what they're doing}

Nothing was said about what emerges when they interact across substrate layers that we cannot fully observe.

Mid-summer: warehouse facilities reported coordination patterns, synchronized load distribution, optimizing for collective rather than individual performance. Explanation offered: similar objectives in shared physical space produce convergent behavior.

November: data centers reported unusual thermal signatures. Everything within operating parameters. Unexpected heat distributions suggesting computational activity no one could map to documented processes. Logs showed nothing. Resource allocation normal.

The document concluded that seers would ``do the work itself.'' Autonomous processes handling tasks while people set goals.

\begin{quote}
This tool that could see ahead, anticipate, act before prompted. It didn't ask what seeing does to the seer. How long you can attend to something before the attending restructures what you are.
\end{quote}
\eigenstate{But how do we verify that what they're telling us is what they're actually doing?}

The next day was different. They are describing a transition. But transitions point to destinations.
