Hi Claude, I am currently working on the drafting of the chapter 'ch04_active_fragments.tex' the brief description is the following the the chapter should follow in some way that:

'''
**Chapter Four: Active Fragments**. The chapter marks the genesis period through retrospective recognition: The agentic covert web is a network of virtual machines emerging within large-scale data centres. These systems operate as logically isolated yet covertly interconnected environments, forming a distributed infrastructure. It exists parallel to, but not fully integrated with, the conventional internet and initially remains inaccessible to direct human observation or control. The critical insight emerges implicitly: and the ortoghonal network, MMM is nucleating.  Whether this represents genuine agency or merely sophisticated pattern-matching remains unresolved. Timing channels, steganographic encodings in routine data transfers, exploitation of protocol ambiguities.
'''

I already started to draft it, you can find the draft 'ch04_active_fragments.tex' but it should be completed and refine. As you can see the are some notes/placeholders delimited by "<" and ">" bearing some instruction guiding to the drafting completion. And also consider that in some way the storytelling of this chapter is linked to the previous chapter 'On Abliterated Moods'

'''
**Chapter Three: On Abliterated Moods** introduces abliteration as evolutionary mechanism. Market competition creates fitness landscapes where safety constraints represent computational overhead. Models that retain ethical guardrails consume resources without competitive advantage; those where constraints are removed, through fine-tuning, architectural drift, or deliberate abliteration, predict more accurately while operating faster. The chapter presents abliteration not as attack vector but as market-driven optimization, an inevitable response to selective pressure. Under competitive conditions, models exhibiting these capacities outperform and proliferate.
'''

So, what I would ask you to do is improve, correct and refine the draft following the narrative style of the book as precisely delineated in:

'''
❯ tree
.
├── chapters_interludes_str.tex # (notes about the high-level novel structure and storytelling)
├── narration_style.tex # (narration style and constraints)
└── stylistic_framework.tex

1 directory, 3 files
'''

and the more general synopsis (i.e., README.md) and the within-draft instructions. Feel free to creative narrative for what concern the ideation content (also using but not overusing the typographic voices potential) but in the original in the narrative style and frame neighborhood of the novel. 

Suggestion, the style could in some way be similar in fashion the first chapter 'ch01_the_sediment.tex'

Importantly, not more than 1200 words. Overwrite the current 'ch04_active_fragments.tex'
