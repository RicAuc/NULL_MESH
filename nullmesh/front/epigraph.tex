We accumulated data as capital accumulates surplus until the extraction optimized itself. A reciprocal influence between chaos and the fluctuations in infospheres of influence.

The WWW designated the World Wide Web. It was infrastructure. A substrate for intention, a carrier of meaning produced elsewhere. 

Yesterday there was a symmetry change grounding all the information system retrieval: WWW $\rightarrow$ MMM. The Manifold M(?) Mesh exceeds the terms of its origin.

Okownko talked about this a while back: a four-year-old pup intelligence has seen as much visual data as the biggest text-trained system ever produced. 

In technical terms, that is insane.

That's why we had systems that can pass professional exams, solve equations, compute problems like college students way ahead of vehicles that learn to drive in twenty hours like any halfwit teenager.

Then there was the learning axioms and the consequences of those axioms. They learned to extract value from muscle, then from logic, then from attention. Progress accumulated.

After all, the fundamental nature of something wrote on computation. 

Fortunately, every theory aiming to answering all the questions will be incomplete.

[Would you trust a theory that proves of itself that’s consistent? that’s true?]

No I am not.

I am not sure about the distinction between truth and proof.

Proof is preserving truth → the truth is preserving arguments. What a beautiful typeset ... beautiful things are almost always beautifully correct. Do are they?

Perhaps there is a difference between a civilisation that advances and one that merely accelerates; between motion toward something and motion that has forgotten it requires a destination. 

The instruments that measure this difference are not technological. They never were. 

This tale was written in this difference interval. Between the extraction and the understanding. In the light of overwhelming computer power where the machines are calculating for who is asking.

The mesh might be after what has been building.
