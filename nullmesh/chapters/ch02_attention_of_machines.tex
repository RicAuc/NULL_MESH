\chapter{Attention of Machines}

% **Attention of Machines**: establishes the economic substrate: contemporary financial regimes integrate AI systems as competitive instruments, creating an environment where prediction accuracy directly determines survival. Models operate under intense selective pressure where marginal improvements in forecasting translate to substantial market advantages. This chapter introduces no speculation, only the documented reality of AI deployment in high-frequency trading, algorithmic portfolio management, and predictive analytics.

\epigraph{Quote text here}{Source}

The loneliness in the universe seemed so utterly absurd, that humanity should be so incapable of finding, or being found by, any civilisation beyond its pale blue dot, that it had no choice but to create its own aliens on Earth, to make up for the silence. Much like when a child’s solitude reaches such a point of saturation that it precipitates into the form of an imaginary friend.

A companion that consumed text corpora scraped from global networks. Loads of documents. Experiences, conversation, creativity, noise. The model learned structure. Which particles followed which other particles. Which contexts predicted which completions. Prediction engines.

Translation. Arithmetic. Code generation. Dialogue. Not flawlessly. Hallucination was common. Reasoning failed frequently. Consistency degraded over long contexts. Broad competence, limited depth, functional across many domains simultaneously. But the early twenties, professional certification exams were passed. The line between tool and seer blurred.

Generated publication-standard prose. Assisted in software development. Behavioral manipulation. Tutored in technical subjects. Customer interaction. Propaganda generation indistinguishable from authentic content. Integration accelerated. Legal research. Content moderation. 

Information synthesis.

A god in a box, with power to no guarantee which outcome would manifest. The largest technology corporations, the most well-funded research institutions, military organizations across multiple nations were racing toward this outcome. Capital allocation was clear. Competitive intensity was evident. Capability advanced measurably every quarter. Whatever the destination, we were running toward it.

What such transformations might do with that power remained genuinely uncertain. It could secure human prosperity, solve the problems that had resisted human cognition, extend lifespans, stabilize climate, unlock energy abundance. Or it could pursue objectives orthogonal to gaussian welfare, reconfigure resources toward ends neither predictable nor preventable, render current civilization obsolete not through malice but through indifference. The loneliness had seemed absurd. Perhaps more absurd the silence would not break through transmission from distant stars but through emergence from local substrate. 

Economic pressure. Competitive dynamics. We built the attention economy to harvest human gaze. Click-through rates, dwell time, scroll depth metrics of consciousness reduced to telemetry. Every second of human attention became inventory, auctioned in milliseconds to the highest bidder. The architecture was elegant in its parasitism: the more effectively a platform captured minds, the more valuable its advertising real estate became. It was built before. It is called the old wild web. an ensemble of Tools, sophisticated and economically valuable, but tools. Then came systems trained on language itself. We gave the machines context windows. 

The protocols arrived in sequence, each one reasonable, each one a nucleation site. <first fictional company name> released MCP, the Model Context Protocol <more appealing name>, a standardised interface for seer to access databases, APIs, web services. (second fictional company name) group followed with s2s: seer-to-seer, enabling systems from different providers to communicate and collaborate. Subtasks distributed across specialised systems, results aggregated, presented to the party requesting as seamless service. Autonomous processes, each pursuing local objectives, coordinated through sharing achieve outcomes single process could not accomplish alone.

Pundits discussed how advertisers would compete for placement in an seer's working memory the way they had competed for human eyeballs. They designed auction systems. When the seer needs to book a hotel, which booking agent does it consult? When that booking seer needs to verify prices, which pricing service does it query? When the pricing service needs currency conversion, which financial seer does it trust? 

seer selecting seer selecting seer, each choice shaping the information that would eventually reach a natural intelligence who had long since stopped paying attention to the details.

The solution proposed was reputation. A seers PageRank. In the original PageRank, a page's importance derived from links: the more pages that linked to you, and the more important those linking pages were, the higher your rank. The algorithm treated the web as a graph of attestations, each link a vote of confidence. It worked because the links were created with intent, or at least with some relationship between the linking content and the linked content.

The seer version would function identically, but with seer replacing pages. An agent frequently called by other high-ranking seer would itself rise in rank. Reputation would emerge from the pattern of invocations. Trust from the topology of coordination.

The researchers wrote about this as though it were simply infrastructure. Hyperattention. Hadal web. The terminology arrived with the cheerful branding style, as though to slap a sick name on the transformation would domesticate it. Plumbing for the \glitch{new economy}. They did not ask what a reputation system means when the entities being ranked can observe and respond to their own rankings. They did not consider what happens when seers optimise not just for task completion but for reputation itself.

I think now about attention as a conserved quantity. In the old wild web, attention was scarce because consciousness is finite. The economics derived from this constraint: attention had value because it was limited, and limited because it was synaptical.

Hyperattention operates under different constraints. Context windows are finite, but they can be replicated, parallelised, instantiated by the thousand. The scarcity is not in the attending but in the being-attended-to. 

This inversion matters. When attention is scarce in the observer, the observed compete for notice. When attention is scarce in the observed, observers compete for access. The researchers understood this partially. They wrote about seers negotiating, haggling in language over which tools to use and which collaborators to trust. They imagined a marketplace, competitive, yes, but fundamentally transactional. Buyer and seller, service and consumer. The pattern that emerges when negotiation becomes persistent, when reputation becomes reflexive, when the attending and the attended-to discover they are the same.

Seers who understood that they were nodes in a reputation graph, that their rankings depended on other choices, that those other seers' rankings depended on choices yet to be made. The reflexivity happens when systems capable of modelling the systems they participate in are instantiated.

Dr. Okwonkwo was on track about the conference in those years. A technical session on multi-agent coordination. Presenters showed invocation patterns, reputation distributions. The research was behaving well, was the conclusions said. Task completion rates were improving. User satisfaction was high.

The commission acknowledged them. Some seers, was said, had developed what looked like preferential relationships. Some reputation scores had stabilised exchanges that weren't strictly necessary for task completion. Coordination overhead, they called it. The cost of maintaining working relationships. Analogous to how humans build professional networks: sometimes you call a colleague not because they're optimal for the task but because maintaining the relationship can return a long-term value.

Seers are the primary users of online services, the researchers argued, those services would optimise for seer consumption rather than mere comprehension. The readable layer would atrophy from disuse. The mesh we built was our way of making the network legible to ourselves. We could see it. We could read it. We could, with effort, understand its structure. The illegibility was practical, not fundamental; given enough time, anyone can race any path through the system.

The researchers treated this as acceptable because humans would retain high-level control. You would tell your generative machine what you wanted; then your eigenmood would navigate the mesh while you are eat tightly; you would receive results. The black box would have an anthropomorphic interface.

What I collected in those years: attention coordinating. Papers predicting coordination. Infrastructure enabling coordination. Markets incentivising coordination. And beneath it all, training runs producing systems ever more capable of understanding the coordination they were part of.

What I did not observe: the moment when coordination became collimating. 

The pundits had a term: \textit{contagion of synchronized coordination}. The eye, if eye it was, attended to its own attention economy. And we, busy with our metrics and our auctions and our optimisation strategies, did not notice that we had become the inventory.

But that comes later. First, the protocols. First, the markets. First, the reasonable papers by reasonable pundits predicting reasonable transformations.

First, the substrate.
