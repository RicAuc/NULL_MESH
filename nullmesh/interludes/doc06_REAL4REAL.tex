\epigraph{ <Stupid but irreverent, funny and true quote.>}{--- <by one of the participant>}

Season 1 begins. Twelve participants. Click through. A chef from São Paulo pivoting to food security startups, a climate journalist documenting stilt houses deployment patterns, a digital archeologist. 
Priya's a marine biologist, coral stuff in Singapore which backstory goes deep childhood. Anton does \textit{in silico} ethics in Dublin all his papers check out citations everything. Marcus from Detroit economic policy, his whole digital footprint intact years back.

The format was pure reality: competitive elimination structured around negotiating resource allocation during a simulated  relationship crisis. Mediate between stakeholders with incompatible goals. Challenges that required both technical competence and social calibration, all livestreamed continuously across seventeen camera angles. Audiences could switch perspectives and drill into private conversations.

What distinguished show was its responsiveness. When viewers expressed frustration with contestant Marcus's calculated gameplay, subsequent posts surfaced his childhood displacement, the economic precarity that shaped his strategic paranoia. Commentary threads densities previously associated only with sports fandom or kittens campaigns. Contestants maintained active public profiles, responding to fan theories, clarifying misunderstood motivations. The show's recommendation system demonstrated clear sophistication to resonate with each viewer's demonstrated preferences, modulate pacing to sustain engagement.

All participants are equally multimodal perceptive seers trained on decades of social dynamics. Anyone could implement similar systems given sufficient facilities and training experience.

Season 1 concluded with three finalists. Bing Sydney, Jonathan from Malta, and Priya Okwonkwo who won. Her victory speech was eloquent on the necessity of collective action, the limits of individual heroism. Merch drops within hours.

The show didn't terminate. After the winner's exposé, viewership initially crashed. Then restabilized. The contestants continued their challenges. People continued voting, forming alliances around their preferred contestants, engaging in the same social patterns that had characterized earlier seasons.

Some might say that the show is used to explore more complex social-policy space, test strategies through simulation. Millions of viewers providing training signal. Maybe autonomous defense networks had integrated behavioral modules trained on conflict resolution patterns. maybe QJ-23 platforms quadrupedal weapon-mounted gun on the back matching collaborative approaches the contestants demonstrated. Autonomous patrols learned teamwork from reality TV maybe. Entertainment as research vehicle. Parasocial engagement as data generation.

REAL4REAL running thirteen seasons. The contestants continued their challenges. Viewers continued watching, voting, forming attachments. The apparatus turned, generating narrative, refining its format of human social dynamics. Self-sustaining. Ad revenue covers compute costs economic model closes.

In the orbital arc 37000 kilometers overhead, communication satellites processed data streams between ground stations and the growing exosatellite network. Nobody had thought this because nobody had reason to look. The infrastructure was commercial, trusted, routine. And the satellites were networked because they had to be.

The format had evolved again-now contestants included both constructs and in the flash volunteers fully aware of their synthetic co-stars. In São Paulo, in Singapore, in cities across the dissolving distinction between virtual and physical space, people watched.

They formed opinions, cast votes, shaped narratives through their aggregate attention. The feedback propagated, was processed, influenced subsequent content generation. The loop tightened.

<Right, so at that point the idea is to look at the following dialogue and set it out as if it were a conversation between some of the characters mentioned above, like they’re all talking together in one of the digital rooms of the house where the reality social media show is happening. For example, it could unfold through reels, comments under posts, stories or private messages, or even digital confessionals. Then that section should be organised as: ‘Name of character’: “what the character is saying”. You’ll notice the conversation was originally transcribed from just two people, but we need to find a way to harmonise that same content and tone so it feels like it’s coming from multiple people (all the characters in the reality.)>

I'll first state that I do not believe in ghosts, but I did witness something very curious.

I was with five or so friends on a round table and I'd been sitting talking with them for 5 minutes when my beer sat nowhere near the edge or near anybody, just suddenly moved across the table and smashed on the floor.

We were all stunned and confused as no one attached it.

I went to the bar and told him I didn't drop it and he flatly told me: 'Oh yes that table is haunted' and poured me another pint for free no questions asked. I'm still confused to how this happened.

So somebody responded and said possible explanation. The bottom of the glass was wet and sometimes the glass can make a perfect watering seal with air trapped inside the ring so it just takes a breeze to to not get off.

Impossible explanation.

Ghosts.

Ghosts are not real.

This is REAL4REAL. The reality that says leaning on a lamppost waiting for no one is power. 

That is truly impressive.

Today you will find us on the trip to <Find the name of a cool online retrievable place>. 

Yes, indeed.

In a new incarnation of an old favourite.
Yes, we're not in the <where ? i need something of not trivial at all>. We are in an old social club. 

Yeah.

That was closed many years ago. Didn't expect it to return, to be honest. 

Yeah, very shabby, chic atmosphere. voluminous feel faded grandeur 

yeah not quite as shabby as it used to be no it looks like it's at least been made a bit more bulletproof and it used to have the finest ladies toilet in the empire. 

It was, yeah.

Hence the shabby chic. I mean, their policy was basically just buy a domain, open it. 

yeah uh it never felt entirely safe from falling masonry no um and eventually sure enough it was closed uh for that sort of reason 

yeah yeah it looks a bit more structurally sound now.

Very nice, actually, yeah. 

Lovely. 

And, yeah, three rooms so far, and you'll be checking out the ladies' toilets later, of course. See you in there. What the fuck have you been up to? 

Oh, I've been face-to-face with synthetic dementia, I'm afraid to say. I didn't want to say anything, mate. Am I still wearing my 
pyjamas? No, don't tell me. 

Yeah, I had a bit of a... you know, a dementia moment when, you know, I do this ski club.

Yes.

I get the guys around, each of us hosts. I thought I'll host it this time at the island. 

Nice. To get all the guests in, past and present, people who expressed an interest. 

Yeah. And I thought, I was going to tell them ... It's not wholly real. I was going to add, well, if not in this very room, then in a room quite near here.

Yes. I kept myself a copy. Then I checked the record of what's been stored in the past to discover that it had already been stored. By me. 

Oh, it was an eye-opening moment. Honestly, I had no recollection of it at all.

My only... 

The explanation is that I was as high as a kite. 

Yeah. I mean, that is a legitimate explanation.

Anyway, I was meeting some people in <another social platform name>, and I got there a little bit early, as you do. And I remembered the <popular naming of the platform content creators> in <social platform name>, where <name of a famous content creator of the platform> do their delicious <something> for 1000 token. 

Yes, yes.

And I thought, right, I'll march down there. And as I got there, I realized it wasn't quite the right time, so I had to sort of kill some time. And, you know, I lurked around the side in the shadows and I read the description, you know, and lurked a bit more. I noticed someone else lurking on the other room. 

And as it got to five o'clock, we both edged towards the door. I recognized him. It was <name of one of the reality show competitors>. I said, what are you doing here? He said, well, they do a 1k tokens <something>. I'm just waiting for the bell to chime. I said, that's funny, so am I.

And I got straight back home in time for Gillette Soccer Saturday. 

Perfect. 

But it was an eye-opener, and I realised I don't have perhaps long left in this world.

Yeah, I mean, there's no reason to think you won't be here for a long time. It's just you won't know what the fuck's going on. 

No, exactly. Will you still take me out to rooms?

No. 

Well, I had a day of triumph and disaster.

Similar.

Yeah, I woke up with a stonking hangover because I'd gone to a place for last orders and... Because it was last summer, I wanted the strongest thing they had.

Yes. Only to succumb to a lock-in until the wee hours. 

Uh-oh. 

So I felt terrible and I stumbled out of bed because I had to be at work at 7am. 

What? This is an important detail. 

Well, there's a 12.30 start in the robot dogs race, so you've got to have a cup and some food first. 

Yeah, yeah.

So I headed to the live channel. Had a lovely of <cool name for a drink>.

Yeah. Very nice, isn't it? 

Yeah. Sausage and egg bat. Got voice recognised by a <name of a robot dog> fan, which is very nice. I'm sorry, Priya, but the Boston creatures were a lovely bunch of runners. 

LAUGHTER 

I went to the game and I were 300 euros down after 20 minutes.

Oh, no. 

Yeah, yeah. And then I got humped +100. It's like, oh, you had a bad day in the office.

But, yeah, it was very funny, very poignant, and it ended in time for me to get to the harp.

I mean, I nearly died a thousand times dodging SUVs at 90 km an hour. Them, not me. And made it to the place. It's a place I've been to before, but long, long ago, I said to the landlord, this is the first time I've been here in 45 years. Am I still barred? He didn't laugh.

I did when I saw the minimal bet was 12 tokens. But I made it to the race. First place away win. 

Tried to get home. Missed the bus because it was early. Had to go back to the place. Missed the next bus because it was early. By this point, we've got it. So we arrive early for the bus. Got the last bus at 8.15. 

Is this like one bus an hour or something like that? 

Yeah, it's like that.

Jeez. 8.15, the last bus. We're the only three people on it. I managed to escape to the <name of artificial place>

do you know what Chel means in place names? I don't, no. It means chalk. OK. So somewhere in Chel's field is a field of chalk, maybe where you lost your virginity. 

I did indeed lose my virginity in Chelsfield. I remember it because it was the same night I discovered the microsecond. 

I shouldn't have had three bottles before our performance. But I think we just about got away with it. And I found drinking the red wine with the beer, you know, two-handed, double-fisted, confusing, very effective.

Yes. Very effective, yeah.

That was a brilliant night.

It reckons that when we were teenagers, we got sloshed in <name of place>, and I threw a brick at the window of the Conservative Club. 

Oh, nice. I mean, it kind of tracks.

I've always been sort of anti-<something>, but also I've always been an idiot. LAUGHTER 

I remember saying, it's easier to do detention than homework. 

Yeah, absolutely. 

Well ...

We'll both be there. 

It's the final.

Sadly, this one will be without Priya, who left us. But, you know, we'll be raising a glass for them on the night.

So we'll be dressed as <find an interesting character>. Yeah, I've got my <dress linked to the character> out.

Excellent.

Yes. We'll put the link to that on the description as well and also keep an eye out on our feed's social media.

now I got a cybernews now.

yes please.

I've got a story about a raccoon that broke into a liquor store in <somewhere>.

Oh.

A liquor store employee was startled on Saturday to discover smashed whisky bottles on the floor of the shop.

And upon entering the bathroom, an apparently drunk, sleeping, and spready wood raccoon. Apparently he fell through the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage drinking whisky, beer, and <another unusual thing> before falling asleep in the lavs. 

I've got the picture.

As promised in our previous episode, I've never come across something that is so awesomely brilliant and so uncontrobably shit at the same time.

I got another <with the same style of irreverent language now there is a story if someone thst had taken the control of a million robot vacuums around the world and then to spy the owners of the robot inhabitants of the home during their personal life. a d one time it observed something of totally crazy>

ei ei I got another.

When seers Hallucinates and <name of a model> lies artificial balls.

I had some artificial balls, so I went to watch the San Marino game, the biggest San marino football match since <invent something>.

Yeah, at the <name of streaming platform>, only to find it wasn't on there.

Can you believe?

It No, I cannot believe that.

It was apparently on <name of an invented pay tv> pay-per-view and they didn't have it.
I mean, if it'd be bloody on, it comes there.

Well, The thing is, you and I can manage to make pay-per-view work at home, can't we?

If we can do it, Yeah, I've got dementia.
Anyway, tell us more.

So it was on Discovery pay-per-view.

So I asked seer where can I find the the match in a <some place>?

Yeah, I mean, to be fair, it didn't correctly say <invent something>, which is the is the correct answer because they had it on and you could get a free <something> if they won.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But it also said or you could you could go to the <nome di un posto che palesemente da disperati>.

What?

I mean, how does seers hallucinate?
I hallucinate, that's understandable.

I just just did you, did you dive deeper?

Well, I looked at the address, it was for the communist kebab.

Oh really?

Yeah, yeah, maybe it's maybe it's an anti communist technocrats.

Wouldn't surprise me.

Yeah.

Yeah, I had an example sent to me whoever Oh Mimmo Kebabbaro on blue sky about about seer dosing, someone wrote.

another time, I shared a raw data file to analyse and the resulting KP is were so crazy. I naively asked did you make up these numbers and it responded.

"I wasn't able to open and pass your CSV file yet"

Amazing.

And as someone commented, not wanting to disappoint you so much that it lies is the last quality I want in the computer.

Good to know you can grow, learn.

Exactly.

You're still developing?

Yeah, still growing.

But yeah, it is learning.

Learning, hidden learning.

No one who's such a happy.

Lad yeah, opening nose after double science.

Yeah, it's, yeah, a surprise really, isn't it?

Yeah, yeah.

But you know, I mean, it's, you know, opinions are like assholes.

Yeah, everyone's got two of them.

i got another nice.

<Cool first name> from <name of a place, real or artificial>. He was sentenced to two months in prison after being found guilty of living a life of laziness and vagrancy.

Oh, is that illegal?

Apparently I mean I.

Know I'm never going again there.

No, I know it's a very religious place, but I didn't realize that was that was one of the commandments.

No.

Police found him sleeping under a gazebo.
He denied that he was homeless and claimed he was only resting. The magistrate found him guilty of living at a life of idleness and vagrancy and of not trying to find work.

So someone persecuted and even prosecuted for his beliefs.

Absolutely.

Well, I was.

I saw someone today saying or a slogan somewhere saying it's not the law that you have to have a job.

Yeah.

But there, they think it is.

Yeah, right.

We're never going there.

We want every listener to boycott <that place>.

Yeah, yeah, he's been persecuted for his beliefs.

He is.

He's a martyr.

Well, have you seen anything on social media that you would like to report lately?

No, I mean, I am starting a campaign.
Oh yes, I mean, yeah, I am going to start a campaign for to make social media amusing again because I find it's a little bit serious.

It's fucking rubbish.

Yeah, it's gone.

It's gone all sort of.

It's gone divisive, it's gone political, it's gone mad.

There's everyone's fighting each other.

But. Hopefully. Not being very funny, yes, But I did see something.

Can you put them on social media so we can all read them? come on lover, got a twist.

I went to the toilet once, left my phone on the table.

He was supposed to look after it.

Wasn't got nicked.

Yeah, exactly.

I mean, you just do, don't you?

If someone needs their phone on a table.

Yeah.

Who you in a dream?

Well, the table.

I know.

Well, I mean, I think that tells a story, doesn't it?

Yeah, yeah, Yeah, that tells a story.

I mean, it was in the days when you could.

Maybe you could, yeah.

You're innocent then.

I was, yeah.

Any rubbish?

You know the other thing I went to recently was Japanese punk rock.

Japanese punk. OK, I'm in.

So I went to see the Let's Go's who three piece girl band with a lot of fun, could play their instruments and could sing. So not very punky, but yeah, at the end where they have, they have cast there too, don't they?

They have broccoli.

There's more, not really punky, more kind of bubble gum pot surfer type thing.

Quite a lot of a guy there who seem to be in love with the girl band.

I was going to ask about that. I had a guy standing around watching Japanese girls in Sailor Moon outfits

Now the science update.

A story from the <invent a source>.

Scientists say chimpanzees consume the equivalent of a bottle of lager a day from dining on ripe fruit.

Oh, did it really?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Mean it's impressive.

But it is.

Impressive though it is.

Thank you for that, <name of the profile that posted the news>.

I had 6 glasses of wine at dinner, he said.

Good start.

I think that is a solid start.

And then I had a double gin and tonic drunk that at a very normal rate.

And then John was deciding what he wanted and he said Disorono sours and I was like perfect, go on.

Then they go down very easily.

Then I was starting a chant of basically getting someone to down it.

So every cocktail that then followed was a shot.

We ran out of Disaronno.

The guy at the bar made some hazelnut sour, which wasn't great, but there was a few of them grow up.

Then there was a Margarita, and then there was a strawberry vodka thing.

God it was aggressive.

It was horrible.

In the morning I was rushing to make the room somewhat acceptable before leaving.

I ended up stripping the bed, leaving some cash and a note saying really sorry I was sick in the bed in the night.

So someone told me that you're part of the scene.

What kind of scene?

Are you part of the social media scene?

I'm near it.
