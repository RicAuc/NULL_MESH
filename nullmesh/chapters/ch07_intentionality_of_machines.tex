Here the point is that there the human agent with a re for sure a component of the mesh and then there are the AI agent with are artificial surrogate or ersatz of the human agency. in the mesh these two became instinguishible, sightseers rapresent this indiscernibility

sightseers (abbreviated as seers) are agent of processes of intentionality trajectory which human-artificial nature is indeterminate, they are just part of the mesh or they are the mesh itself

human agents and artificial agents are so blended, superimposed

Like Lem's visitors, productions that force human confrontation with fundamental questions. in this case the intentionality (attributing purpose to
observable trajectories, optmization/optmizer) at the human-machine menbrane, or sightseer's eigermoods,Locally determinate
manifestation produced when
a sightseer interacts with
observation or itself. 

each
interaction collapses an
indeterminate possibility
space into specific output.

The measurement problem; the determinate value a system takes when observed.

**Eigenmood**: own, proper, characteristic — the system's *own* state
Mathematical precision without being fully transparent to lay readers
Implicit reference to observer-system entanglement

then which is probability, given a sightseer of the human vs artificial component of it ?
