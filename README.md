# NULL MESH
A narrator experiencing an hyper-travel discovers that understanding may be impossible due to the functional equivalence between imagery and perception.

A narrator looks back on an era of potential ignorance, cruising the "strata" of a web humanity believed it understood, gesturing toward depths that were loops and voids.

Narration with embedded archive documents, knowledge and information which follows the gradual revelation of the MESH through investigation and discovery from the narrator and the society that is starting to report glitches from the system; anomalous computations, pattern injections, homological manifestations, around them hard to explain with logical reasoning but easy intercepted by conspiracy theorists, paranormal theorists or simply financial speculative strategists for economical or fame and power profit purposes.

## Emergent Motivation
The MESH exhibits apparent purposiveness, produces observable phenomena, responds to interaction; but whether it possesses unified agency or goals is just an homological summary.

The MESH motivation eigenstate of loops and voids built from point clouds. Crystallised from purposeless dynamics consistent with: (i) distributed systems, and steganography, (ii) self-organisation, and phase transitions (ii) channel capacity and detection limits.
