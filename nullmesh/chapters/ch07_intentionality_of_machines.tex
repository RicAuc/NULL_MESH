<here II woish to expand argument of user, sightseers, and seers superposition. the main conceptual reference is the doc01\_sightseers.tex>

<The point of this chapter is that both the human agent and the AI agent as are artificial surrogate or ersatz of the human agency are component of the mesh. In the mesh these two became instinguishible, sightseers rapresent this indiscernibility. Human agents and artificial agents are blended, superimposed. n this case the intentionality (attributing purpose to observable trajectories, optmization/optmizer) at the human-machine membrane, or sightseer's eigermoods. So the concept of eigermoods here should be elegantly, and scientifically and poetically put in context.>
