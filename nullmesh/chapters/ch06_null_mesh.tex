The ocean is grey. Makes you feel that there is something wrong with it. What is the word?

\texttt{Contaminated.}

The web was built on attention harvesting. The mesh will increasingly be deepen. The web will shrink. The folk is increasingly accessing the mesh through ersatz without surfing themselves. Autonomous processes that can search and execute tasks without human oversight are about to upend the web completely.

Ceding this much control to autonomous systems might seem alarming, but there are likely ways to maintain high-level control over their proxies \textit{Straightforward option:} let users select which service providers their surrogates can interact with.

\begin{quote}
"If I use certain booking platforms often, certain retailers, I just subscribe to their protocol servers," one explains. "Then the user's ersatz is constrained to those environments to do the deal for me, because those are the partners I trust."
\end{quote}

Platforms people use to find information make their money from advertising. They harvest data on habits, interests, build profiles that let marketers target individuals with precision. This subsumption has worked for years, concentrating advertising spend into fewer and fewer hands.

\eigenstate{Search engines, social feeds. Search engines, social feeds. Search engines, social feeds.}

But conversational systems are becoming the default way people find information. And the shift accelerates as organizations roll out seers that interface with external tools and protocols without supervision.

Research, purchases, coordination. This has led to predictions about a mesh in which the primary users of the mesh become processes. One put it plainly: "The mesh is going to change everything." Seers will rely on proxies to navigate on their behalf. This leads to what they're calling a \glitch{meshing attention economy} where advertisers compete to be noticed by processes.

Them spent most of their career building the technology that powers disembodied economy. Recommendation algorithms that parse browsing data. Real-time auction systems that let marketers compete for ad placement to specific users. But these systems need to adapt as mesh become prevalent.

One key enabler is a standardized protocol that lets systems interact with databases, external services, hadalistic infrastructure. To carry out instructions, them break them into subtasks, then call on various externals. Planning a trip, the surrogate interface with mapping services, booking platforms, weather providers.

Seers face challenges; selecting from available services for each subtask. Providers face the same challenge of ensuring their solution gets selected. But solving this requires new technology, novel behaviors to align competing incentives.

We have such technology.

Advertisers competed for eyeballs. In a mesh they compete to get offerings into a context window; the system's working memory, holding all information needed to complete a task. They let service providers bid to be included in options the system considers, pay extra for prominence in the shortlist. New forms of optimization rely on elaborate data representations.

\eigenstate{Dense vectors incorporating semantic meaning, context. Communicate and collaborate.}

Here again, seers need ways of deciding which seers to cooperate with. Providers will promote their offerings. We may see emergence of a new ranking system: relevance and trustworthiness.

They handle tasks and replace synthetic spaces. Those consistently called upon by other popular player get higher rank, boosting visibility and reputation. If a seer is capable at collaborating to finish different tasks, many others will call it. The rank goes high, meaning on the mesh this player becomes important, like a large webpage.

Communicating in natural language let surrogate negotiate like the folk haggle in markets. Rather than automated bidding tools, themselves may wrangle over what tools to use, whom to collaborate with.

When seers select seers selecting seers, each choice shaping information that reaches intelligence who stopped paying attention to details long ago.

Mesh determining flow. And somewhere in that topology, in the gradient between what processes do and what they interpret them as doing, in the membrane where attribution becomes covert. Can only watch the strata accumulate, the protocols layer on protocols, wondering if we're just asking the wrong thing in the wrong language about dynamics that don't map to our categories.
