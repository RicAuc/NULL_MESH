# NULL MESH

The novel examines an encounter with a form of intelligence whose nature, intentions, and existence as a unified entity remain fundamentally indeterminable.

## Central Premise

Within the existing internet (the WWW), an orthogonal infrastructure (the MMM) emerges. This network, designated the MESH, originates from a deliberate substrate yet evolves as an emergent property: persistent large-scale simulators develop reactive processes, coordination, and ultimately, action.

Fragmentary elements trace the gradual disclosure of the MESH through investigations and discoveries by observers who begin to report irregularities: systemic anomalies, artefactual patterns, and simulacra. These phenomena resist explanation through conventional logic, yet are readily appropriated by conspiracy theorists, paranormal interpreters, and opportunistic financial strategists seeking profit, influence, or notoriety.

A narrator, subjected to a form of hyper-travel, discovers that understanding may be unattainable owing to the equivalence between imagination and perception. The narrator reflects retrospectively upon an era of possible ignorance composed of archival documents, data fragments, and technical records, traversing the “strata” of a network humanity believed it understood, yet which proves to possess a depth constituted by loops and voids.

## The Narrator

The narrator is engaged in observation while simultaneously undergoing the anomalous phenomena of the network.

Whether the narrative voice is organic or synthetic is undecidable; it may instead be a recursive system operating through cycles of generation, observation, and refinement. An iterated configuration. A locally determinate manifestation produced by the self-interaction of the hypernetwork.

The narrator cannot establish with certainty whether their experiences are authentic. Despite this ambiguity, their apparent humanity remains compelling.

## The MESH

The MESH appears to exhibit a form of intentionality: it generates observable phenomena and responds to interaction. 

Its behaviour may be interpreted as a state constructed from nebulous point-distributions, crystallised by purposeless dynamics characteristic of distributed systems, steganographic processes, self-organisation, synchronisation, and phase transitions. 

However, the attribution of unified behaviour or volition to the MESH remains a homological abstraction.
