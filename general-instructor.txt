Hi Claude, I am currently working on the drafting of the chapter 'ch03_on_abliterated_moods.tex' the brief description is:

'''

'''

I already starting to draft it, you can find the draft 'ch03_on_abliterated_moods.tex' here attached, but it shuold be completed and refine. As you can see the are some notes/placeholders delimited by "<" and ">" bearing some instruction guiding to the drafting completion.

So, what I would ask you to do is improve, correct and refine the draft following the narrative style of the book as precisely delineated in:

'''
❯ tree
.
├── chapters_interludes_str.tex # (notes about the high-level novel structure and storytelling)
├── narration_style.tex # (narration style and constraints)
└── stylistic_framework.tex

1 directory, 3 files
'''

and the more general synopsis (i.e., README.md) and the within-draft instructions. Feel free to creative narrative for what concern the ideation content (also using but not overusing the typographic voices potential) but in the original in the narrative style and frame neighborhood of the novel.

(not more then 700 words)
