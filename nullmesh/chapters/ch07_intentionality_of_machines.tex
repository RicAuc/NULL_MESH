Here the point is that there the human agent with a re for sure a component of the mesh and then there are the AI agent with are artificial surrogate or ersatz of the human agency. in the mesh these two became instinguishible, sightseers rapresent this indiscernibility

sightseers (abbreviated as seers) are agent of processes of intentionality trajectory which human-artificial nature is indeterminate, they are just part of the mesh or they are the mesh itself

human agents and artificial agents are so blended, superimposed

Like Lem's visitors, productions that force human confrontation with fundamental questions. in this case the intentionality (attributing purpose to

% The measurement problem; the determinate value a system takes when observed.

% - **Eigenmood**: own, proper, characteristic — the system's *own* state
% - Mathematical precision without being fully transparent to lay readers
% - Implicit reference to observer-system entanglement
%
% Recent studies have actually applied quantum probability formalisms to model cognitive  probabilistic phenomena

Ten which is probability, given a sightseer of the humna vs artificial component of it ?

% On the other side, we can image to quantify consciousness as integrated information, where some researchers have explored quantum extensions where:
%
% - Superposition increases integrated information
% - Entanglement creates non-classical correlations contributing to this integrated information
% - Quantum coherence might enable higher integration than classical systems

% quantum-cognitive concepts inform the novel's architecture, create resonances for readers who recognise them, provide rigorous grounding for certain phenomena, but remain implicit (one layer among several, never explicitly named as "the explanation")
%
% To sum up, foregrounding quantum risks providing "the answer" (i.e., the network is quantum, mystery solved). Collateral integration keeps the mystery intact by making quantum frameworks one failed interpretation among many.
